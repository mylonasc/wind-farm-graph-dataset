# FLORIS farm dataset
A dataset for graph neural network modeling of wind farms. The current version of the dataset contains two farms, with very different geometry but similar inter-turbine statistics. The wind farms were simulated with the steady-state wake model [FLORIS](https://github.com/NREL/floris)
